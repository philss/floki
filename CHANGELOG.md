## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [0.35.3] - 2024-01-25

This release has great performance improvements, thanks to the PRs
from [@ypconstante](https://github.com/ypconstante)!

Most of the main functions, such as `Floki.raw_html/2` and `Floki.find/2` are
faster and are using less memory. It's something like twice as fast, and half
usage of memory for `find/2`, for example.

### Fixed

- Add `:leex` to Mix compilers. Fixes the build when running with dev version of Elixir.
  Thanks [@wojtekmach](https://github.com/wojtekmach).

- Fix `Floki.raw_html/2` when a tree using attributes as maps is given.
  Thanks [@SupaMic](https://github.com/SupaMic).

- Add a guard to `Floki.find/2` so people can have a better error message when an
  invalid input is given. Thanks [@Hajto](https://github.com/Hajto).

- Fix parsers to consider IO data as inputs. This may change in the next version
  of Floki, as I plan to drop support for IO data.
  Thanks [@ypconstante](https://github.com/ypconstante).

### Removed

- Remove outdated Gleam wrapper code. The external functions syntax in Gleam
  has [changed](https://gleam.run/book/tour/external-functions.html). So now
  the wrapper is not needed anymore.
  Thanks [@michallepicki](https://github.com/michallepicki).

## [0.35.2] - 2023-10-25

### Fixed

- Enable usage of IO data by removing a guard for binaries in the main
  parser module.

## [0.35.1] - 2023-10-16

### Fixed

- Fix a small regression of the mochiweb parser that was breaking when a
  malformed HTML was used. For more details, see the original issue:
  https://github.com/philss/floki/issues/492

## [0.35.0] - 2023-10-13

### Added

- Add support for parsing attributes as maps.

  This makes `parse_document/2` and `parse_fragment/2` accept the option
  `:attributes_as_maps` to change the behaviour and return attributes as
  maps instead of lists of tuples.
  The only parser that does not support it yet is the `fast_html`.

### Changed

- Drop support for Elixir v1.11.

- Change the log level of parsing logger calls from "info" to "debug".
  This will help to reduce the amount of noise in production apps.

## [0.34.3] - 2023-06-02

### Added

- Add boolean option `:include_inputs` to `Floki.text/2` that changes the result
  of this function to include the values of inputs. So if there is any input with
  a "value" attribute, we now include that value if this option is set to `true`.
  Thanks [@viniciusmuller](https://github.com/viniciusmuller).

### Fixed

- Fix find of elements by classes that contain colons. This is useful for when 
  people are trying to find elements that contain Tailwind classes.
  Thanks [@viniciusmuller](https://github.com/viniciusmuller).

- Fix some typespecs that were using types from private modules. This is a fix
  to the documentation.

## [0.34.2] - 2023-02-24

### Added

- Add option to pass down arguments to the parser in `Floki.parse_document/2` and
  `Floki.parse_fragment/2`. Thanks [@Kuret](https://github.com/Kuret).

- Add support for returning more elements from the `Floki.traverse_and_update/2` function callback.
  This enables the creation of more elements in the tree, but should be used with care,
  since the tree can grow a lot if the change is not controlled. Thanks [@martosaur](https://github.com/martosaur).

## [0.34.1] - 2023-02-11

### Fixed

- Fix pseudo-class ":not" selector parsing halting point.
  This is a fix for when a "pseudo-class" ":not" that contains an attribute selector is
  followed by another selector. This is an example: "a:not([class]), div".

- Ignore decimal numeric char ref when number is negative.

## [0.34.0] - 2022-11-03

### Added

- User configurable "self-closing" tags. Now it's possible to define which tags are considered
"self-closing". Thanks [@inoas](https://github.com/inoas).

### Fixed

- Allow attribute values to not be escaped. This fixes `Floki.raw_html/2` when used with the
option `encode: false`. Thanks [@juanazam](https://github.com/juanazam). 
- Fix `traverse_and_update/3` spec. Thanks [@WLSF](https://github.com/WLSF).

### Changed

- Drop support for Elixir 1.9 and 1.10.
- Remove `html_entities` dependency. We now use an internal encoder/decoder for entities.
- Change the main branch name to `main`.

## [0.33.1] - 2022-06-28

### Fixed

- Remove some warnings for unused code.

## [0.33.0] - 2022-06-28

### Added

- Fix and improve internal things - thanks [@derek-zhou](https://github.com/derek-zhou) and [@hissssst](https://github.com/hissssst)

## [0.32.1] - 2022-03-24

### Fixed

- Allow root nodes to be selected using pseudo-classes - thanks [@rzane](https://github.com/rzane)

## [0.32.0] - 2021-10-18

### Added

- Add an HTML tokenizer written in Elixir - this still experimental and it's not stable API yet.
- Add support for HTML IDs containing periods in the selectors - thanks [@Hugo-Hache](https://github.com/Hugo-Hache)
- Add support for case-insensitive CSS attribute selectors - thanks [@fcapovilla](https://github.com/fcapovilla)
- Add the `:root` pseudo-class selector - thanks [@fcapovilla](https://github.com/fcapovilla)

## [0.31.0] - 2021-06-11

### Changed

- Treat `style` and `title` tags as plaintext in Mochiweb - thanks [@SweetMNM](https://github.com/SweetMNM)

## [0.30.1] - 2021-03-29

### Fixed

- Fix typespecs of `Floki.traverse_and_update/2` to make clear that it does not accept text nodes directly.

## [0.30.0] - 2021-02-06

### Added

- Add ":disabled" pseudo selector - thanks [@vnegrisolo](https://github.com/vnegrisolo)
- Add [Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam) adapter - thanks [@CrowdHailer](https://github.com/CrowdHailer)
- Add pretty option to `Floki.raw_html/2` - thanks [@evaldobratti](https://github.com/evaldobratti)
- Add `html_parser` option to `parse_` functions. This enables a more dynamic and functional
configuration of the HTML parser in use.

### Changed

- Remove support for Elixir 1.7 - thanks [@carlosfrodrigues](https://github.com/carlosfrodrigues)
- Replace `IO.warn` by `Logger.info` for deprecation warnings - thanks [@juulSme](https://github.com/juulSme)

## [0.29.0] - 2020-10-02

### Added

- Add `Floki.find_and_update/3` that updates nodes inside a tree, like traverse and update
but without allowing changes in the children nodes. There for the tree cannot grow in size,
but can have nodes removed.

### Changed

- Deprecate `Floki.map/2` because we have now `Floki.find_and_update/3` and `Floki.traverse_and_update/2` that
are powerful APIs. `Floki.map/2` can be replaced by `Enum.map/2` as well - thanks [@josevalim](https://github.com/josevalim) for the idea!
- Update optional dependency `fast_html` to `v2.0.4`

### Changed

- Update optional dependency `fast_html` to `v1.0.3`

## [0.25.0] - 2020-01-26

### Added

- Add `Floki.parse_fragment!/1` and `Floki.parse_document!/1` that has the same functionality of
the functions without the bang, but they return the document or fragment without the either tuple
and will raise exception in case of errors - thanks [@schneiderderek](https://github.com/schneiderderek)
- Add `Floki.traverse_and_update/3` which accepts an accumulator which is useful to keep
the state while traversing the HTML tree - thanks [@Dalgona](https://github.com/Dalgona)

### Changed

- Update the `html_entities` dependency from `v0.5.0` to `v0.5.1`

## [0.24.0] - 2020-01-01

### Added

- Add support for [`fast_html`](https://hexdocs.pm/fast_html), which is a "C Node" wrapping
Lexborisov's [myhtml](https://github.com/lexborisov/myhtml) - thanks [@rinpatch](https://github.com/rinpatch)
- Add setup to run our test suite against all parsers on CI - thanks [@rinpatch](https://github.com/rinpatch)

- Configure `dialyxir` in order to run Dialyzer easily.

### Changed

- Deprecate `Floki.parse/1` and all the functions that uses it underneath. This means that all
the functions that accepted HTML as binary are deprecated as well. This includes `find/2`, `attr/4`,
`filter_out/2`, `text/2` and `attribute/2`. The recommendation is to use those functions with an
already parsed document or fragment.

Huge thanks to [@henrik](https://github.com/henrik) and [@licyeus](https://github.com/licyeus) that pointed the
[issue](https://github.com/philss/floki/issues/24)!

## [0.4.0] - 2015-09-17

### Added

- A robust representation of selectors in order to enable queries using a mix of selector types,
such as classes with attributes, attributes with types, classes with classes and so on.
Here is a list with examples of what is possible now:
  - `Floki.find(html, "a.foo")`
  - `Floki.find(html, "a.foo[data-action=post]")`
  - `Floki.find(html, ".foo.bar")`
  - `Floki.find(html, "a.foo[href$='.org']")`
Thanks to [@licyeus](https://github.com/licyeus) to point out the [issue](https://github.com/philss/floki/issues/18)!
- Include `mochiweb` in the applications list at mix.exs - thanks [@EricDykstra](https://github.com/EricDykstra)

### Changed

- `Floki.find/2` will now return a list instead of tuple when searching only by IDs.
For now on, Floki should always return the results inside a list, even if it's an ID match.

### Removed

- `Floki.find/2` does not accept tuples as selectors anymore.
This is because with the robust selectors representation, it won't be necessary to query directly using
tuples or another data structures rather than string.

## [0.3.3] - 2015-08-23

HTML attributes other than "class" or "id".
E.g: `Floki.find(html, "[data-model=user]")` - [@nelsonr](https://github.com/nelsonr)

## [0.2.1] - 2015-06-04
