### Changed

- Using Logger to notify unkwon tokens in selector parser - thanks @teamon and @geonnave

## [0.7.0] - 2015-11-03

the flag `js: true` - thanks @vikeri!

### Fixed

- Fix find for sibling nodes when the precendent selector match an element
at the end of sibling list - fix [issue #39](https://github.com/philss/floki/issues/39)

## [0.6.1] - 2015-10-11

## [0.4.1] - 2015-09-18

### Fixed

- Ignoring other files that are not lexer files (".xrl") under `src/` directory
in Hex package. This fixes a crash when compiling using OTP 17.5 on Mac OS X.
Huge thanks for @henrik and @licyeus that pointed the
[issue](https://github.com/philss/floki/issues/24)!

## [0.4.0] - 2015-09-17

### Added

- A robust representation of selectors in order to enable queries using a mix of selector types,
such as classes with attributes, attributes with types, classes with classes and so on.
Here is a list with examples of what is possible now:
  - `Floki.find(html, "a.foo")`
  - `Floki.find(html, "a.foo[data-action=post]")`
  - `Floki.find(html, ".foo.bar")`
  - `Floki.find(html, "a.foo[href$='.org']")`
Thanks to @licyeus to point out the [issue](https://github.com/philss/floki/issues/18)!
- Include mochiweb in the applications list at mix.exs - thanks @EricDykstra

### Changed

- `Floki.find/2` will now return a list instead of tuple when searching only by IDs.
For now on, Floki should always return the results inside a list, even if it's an ID match.

### Removed

- `Floki.find/2` does not accept tuples as selectors anymore.
This is because with the robust selectors representation, it won't be necessary to query directly using
tuples or another data structures rather than string.

## [0.3.3] - 2015-08-23

### Fixed

- Fix `Floki.find/2` when there is a non-HTML input.

### Fixed

- Fix `Floki.DeepText` when there is a comment inside nodes.

## [0.3.1] - 2015-06-21

### Fixed

- Fix `Floki.find/2` to consider XML trees.

## [0.3.0] - 2015-06-07

### Added

- Add attribute equals selector. This feature enables the user to search using
HTML attributes other than "class" or "id".
E.g: Floki.find(html, "[data-model=user]") - @nelsonr

## [0.2.1] - 2015-06-04

### Fixed

- Fix `parse/1` when parsing a part of HTML without a root node - @antonmi
